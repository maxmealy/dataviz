# dataviz

## what
These are some scripts, graphics, and datasets that I used in Johns Hopkins Universityâ€™s Data Visualization for Policy Analysis class in Spring 2017. They all relate to public transportation usage trends in the USA and Europe, and feature a variety of types of visualizations, from barplots and scatterplots to treemaps and chloropleths.

## how
The scripts are all Jupyter notebooks written in Python 3. Almost all use pandas and matplotlib to some extent for loading, processing, and visualizing data. Some visualizations used other libraries, such as networkx and squarify.

## why
This was my first attempt at data visualization with Python, and I found that there was not always documentation on how to make all of the same visualizations you can make in R. I found it incredibly helpful to look at others work and code while creating these, so am posting these as well in case others find these helpful.
